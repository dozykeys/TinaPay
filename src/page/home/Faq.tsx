              <p>
                The exchange rates for cryptocurrencies on TinaPay are
                determined by a variety of factors, including market demand and

              <p>
                Tina Tags are unique identifiers that are linked to your TinaPay
                account. They are designed to make it easier for you to send and
                receive money from other TinaPay users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of having to enter a recipient's bank account details or
                phone number every time you want to send them money, you can
                simply use their Tina Tag. This makes the process faster and
                more convenient, as you don't have to worry about typing in long
                strings of numbers and letters.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can create your own Tina Tag in the TinaPay app, and share
                it with your friends, family, and colleagues to make it easier
                for them to send you money.

                To receive payments on TinaPay, you can provide the person
                sending you money with your Tina Tag or your crypto wallet
                address.
              </p>
              <p>
                If they have your Tina Tag, they can simply enter it in the
                recipient field when making a payment. If they have your crypto
                address, they can use the address from the TinaPay app to
                transfer money directly to your account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a payment has been sent to you, you will receive a
                notification in the TinaPay app. You can then choose to either
                leave the money in your TinaPay account or transfer it to your
                bank account.
